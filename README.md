## About Me

I’m Amir, and I began my programming journey in November 2022. Learning on my own, I faced numerous challenges and tough days, but I persevered and never gave up. This project is a reflection of the skills and knowledge I've acquired throughout this journey. Thank you for taking the time to check it out!

## About the Project

This project is a culmination of everything I've learned since I began my programming journey in November 2022. It includes an authentication system (sign in, sign up, password reset, and user information updates), along with multiple pages and features:

- *Authentication System*: Includes sign in, sign up, password reset, and user email and password updates.
- *Discount Model*: A unique model that appears when the project is opened for the first time, offering a close button and a "Don't Show Me Again" option.
- *Navigation*: Two navbars—main and secondary—provide easy access throughout the site.
- *Home Page*: Features a banner, category slider, product slider, brand banner, and a footer with a subscription form.
- *Products Page*: Displays all products available on the site.
- *Categories Page*: Lists all categories; clicking a category leads to a page with related products.
- *Brands Page*: Displays all brands; clicking on a brand leads to a page with products related to that brand.
- *Cart*: Shows added products in the cart, along with a summary including the total, shipping, and checkout details.
- *Wishlist*: Displays all favorite products added by the user.

## Technologies Used
